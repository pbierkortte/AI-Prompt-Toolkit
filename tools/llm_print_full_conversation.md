# Print Full Conversation

This tool is designed to help you easily save or export your conversation with an AI chatbot, especially in situations where the platform's built-in export functionality is limited or unavailable. It formats the conversation into a readable Q&A format.

> [!TIP]
> This tool relies on the AI's ability to access and recall the entire conversation history. It's most effective when used within the same conversation thread and when the AI has sufficient context.

### Usage
To use this tool, simply paste the provided prompt at the end of your conversation.

### Prompt
```
This was a great conversation can you output this whole conversation in the form of a Q&A, Question: Answer for each message. Indicate which is the "Q: ..." and which is the "A: ...". Also, do not omit context if given include it as part of the question if given. Additionally, you can fix minor spelling in the questions, but try to maintain the answers verbatim. Lastly preserve formatting where possible, or use markdown. Thanks.
```

### Summary

The goal is to create a user-friendly and easily exportable record of the entire conversation in a Q&A format. 

### Tasks

1. **Recall Conversation History:** The AI must accurately recall all previous messages within the conversation.
2. **Format as Q&A:**  Transform the conversation into a series of questions and answers, clearly labeling each with "Q:" and "A:".
3. **Preserve Context:** Include any relevant context or instructions provided within the questions.
4. **Maintain Formatting:**  Retain original formatting (e.g., bold, italics, code blocks) or use Markdown to represent it. 
5. **Minor Spelling Corrections:** Correct minor spelling errors in the questions while keeping answers verbatim.

### Best Practices

1. Use the prompt at the **very end** of your conversation for optimal recall.
2. Ensure the AI has not reached its context window limit, which could cause it to forget earlier parts of the conversation.
3. Verify the output for accuracy, especially if the conversation was lengthy or complex.

### Limitations

- Relies heavily on the AI's ability to remember the entire conversation.
- May not be effective with AI models that have limited context windows. 
- Accuracy may decrease as the length and complexity of the conversation increase.
- Cannot recover messages that were deleted or edited after they were sent.
