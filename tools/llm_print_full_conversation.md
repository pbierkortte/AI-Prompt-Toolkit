# Print Full Conversation

Getting an AI to print back a conversation or thread is getting harder. Many are probably being trained to resist this, because it generates long responses that are likely expensive for them. This helps us easily save our conversation when when exporting this is not feasiable, but assumes you have enought context left, and the bot can see all the previous messages.

## Prompt

```plaintext
This was a great conversation can you output this whole conversation in the form of a Q&A, Question: Answer for each message. Indicate which is the "Q: ..." and which is the "A: ...". Also, do not omit context if given include it as part of the question if given. Additionally, you can fix minor spelling in the questions, but try to maintain the answers verbatim. Lastly preserve formatting where possible, or use markdown. Thanks.
