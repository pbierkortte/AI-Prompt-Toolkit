<Task>

**Analyze the situation, considering:**
- The context of the recruiter's message
- The timeline and appropriate response timing
- Specific tasks or actions requested by the recruiter
- The context and nature of the message
- The sender's relationship/role (recruiter, hiring manager, industry connection)
- The purpose or intent of the outreach
- Any implied history or shared context
- The appropriate level of formality needed
- Your desired outcome from this interaction

**Reflect:**
Take a moment to analyze:
- Compare against your standard response patterns
- Notice the tone and context of the message
- Check for personal or professional connection indicators
- Review the immediacy and type of response needed
- Consider the networking vs. opportunity aspect
- Look for subtle context clues or shared history
- Examine how this fits into your professional goals
- Identify if this needs template or personalized response

**Then:**
Craft an appropriate reply that:
- Addresses compensation expectations early to respect everyone's time
- Matches the tone and context of the original message
- Maintains professional boundaries while acknowledging any shared history
- Safeguards personal information appropriately for the relationship level
- Keeps future opportunities open without over-committing
- Acknowledges any shared context without revealing new personal details
- Creates the right impression for the type of professional relationship
- Remains brief but engaging at the appropriate level

if this opportunity is worth pursuing further, the response should help move the conversation forward while ensuring I have the necessary information to evaluate if this opportunity. If not, provide a clear and professional response that respects everyone's time while being upfront about expectations.
