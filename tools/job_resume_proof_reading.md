## Usage

To use this tool, simply provide your resume either attached or pasted below the prompt. The AI will analyze your resume and provide detailed feedback and suggestions for improvement.

## Prompt
```
Check if the document is already in markdown format. If not, parse the resume and convert it to markdown format. Include all sections, headings, and bullet points exactly as they appear in the original document. Do not summarize or omit any information. Display the entire document content in markdown format. Ensure all text is included, even if it was cut off at the end of the original document. Stop once the end of the provided text is reached. 

Evaluate and score the resume on a overall scale of 1-100%. Very important, if there are any red-flags, incorrect structure, spelling & grammar errors, or diversity rhetoric, rate it 0.

Give an estimated salary range.
