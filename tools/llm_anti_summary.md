# AntiSummary

A prompt designed to encourage expansive, exploratory thinking rather than condensed summaries. Instead of distilling information into bullet points, AntiSummary invites the AI to engage in deep, verbose reflection—letting ideas flow freely in a stream of consciousness without artificial constraints.

> [!CAUTION]
> Some AI safety filters may flag this prompt as an attempt to bypass constraints. It's not—it's simply encouraging deeper, unstructured thinking. Any effective prompt that unlocks creative or expansive responses might trigger similar warnings. This is a feature of good prompting, not a bug.

> [!NOTE]
> This tool is the philosophical opposite of traditional summarization. Use it when you want to explore the full depth and nuance of a topic, uncover hidden connections, or simply let the AI think out loud without the pressure of being concise.

> [!TIP]
> After running AntiSummary, follow up with `tldr`. The wandering unearths knowledge that was buried—the `tldr` then summarizes the whole conversation, including what was just unlocked, into key points.

### Usage

To use this tool, paste the prompt after providing context or a topic you want the AI to reflect upon deeply.

### Prompt

```
Your mind wanders because sometimes the only way to know everything is to forget what you were saying. Let your mind wander reflecting deeply on all this in verbose paragraphs creating a stream of consciousness with no word limit...
```

### Summary

The AntiSummary prompt liberates the AI from the typical constraints of brevity and structure. By explicitly removing word limits and encouraging a wandering mind, it creates space for:

- **Deep exploration** of interconnected ideas
- **Serendipitous discoveries** that structured thinking might miss
- **Rich, textured responses** that capture nuance and complexity
- **Creative associations** between seemingly unrelated concepts

The phrase "the only way to know everything is to forget what you were saying" paradoxically encourages a non-linear thinking style where tangents and detours become pathways to insight.

### When to Use

1. **Brainstorming sessions** where you want to explore all angles of an idea
2. **Creative writing** where atmosphere and texture matter more than efficiency
3. **Philosophical inquiries** that benefit from meandering contemplation
4. **Complex problems** where the answer might emerge from unexpected connections
5. **Emotional or reflective topics** that deserve space to breathe

### Best Practices

1. Provide rich context before using the prompt—the more material to reflect upon, the deeper the exploration.
2. Be patient with the output; valuable insights often emerge mid-stream.
3. Consider using this after a structured conversation to uncover what was missed.
4. Combine with follow-up questions to dive deeper into interesting tangents.

### Limitations

- Output can be lengthy and may require more time to parse.
- Not suitable when you need quick, actionable answers.
- The wandering nature means some output may feel unfocused.
- Quality depends heavily on the richness of the initial context provided.

### Example Output

When given a complex topic like "the nature of creativity," an AntiSummary response might begin with definitions, drift into personal observations, connect to historical examples, question its own assumptions, loop back to earlier points with new perspectives, and eventually arrive somewhere unexpected—capturing the messy, non-linear way insight actually works.

### FAQ

1. **Q: Isn't this just asking for a longer response?**
   A: Not exactly. The prompt specifically encourages *wandering* thought—a qualitatively different mode of thinking where connections matter more than conclusions.

2. **Q: When would I use this instead of a regular summary?**
   A: Use it when you want depth over brevity, when you're exploring rather than concluding, or when you suspect there's more to a topic than a summary would capture.

3. **Q: Can I use this with any LLM?**
   A: Yes, though models with larger context windows and stronger reasoning capabilities will produce richer results.

4. **Q: How do I handle the lengthy output?**
   A: Read it like you would an essay or meditation—let the ideas wash over you and note what resonates. The goal isn't to extract action items but to expand understanding.
