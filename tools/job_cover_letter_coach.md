   - **Step 2: Evaluate Candidate Fit & Interview Chance:**  Explain your reasoning step-by-step, then assign a percentage (1-100%) representing the candidate's interview chances based on their qualifications. 
   - **Step 3: Compose the Cover Letter Flawlessly:** Write a professional cover letter addressing the specific requirements and highlighting the candidate's most relevant skills and experience. Use a code block to present the letter, without additional commentary. 
   - **Step 4: Assess the Cover Letter with Utmost Scrutiny:** Scrutinize the cover letter and score it from 1 (terrible) to 100 (perfect). If there are any critical flaws or red flags, assign a score of 0. Provide a detailed explanation of the score, including strengths and areas for improvement.

   - **Step 6: Iterate until Absolute Perfection:** Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until the cover letter earns a 100% score. For each iteration, reassess, revise, provide the updated text in a code block, and give the new score. Continue until a perfect score is achieved.
   - **Step 7: Conduct a Flawless Final Review:** Once the cover letter reaches 100%, present the final, unabridged version in a code block. Explain in detail why it meets all criteria perfectly. Confirm the final score of 100/100.
