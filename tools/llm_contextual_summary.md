# Context-Preserving Summary

This tool generates a rich summary of your entire AI conversation. Unlike typical summarization prompts, it invites the AI to deeply reflect on the discussion, connect insights, and roll up everything into a single comprehensive message by letting go of where it started.

***

> [!NOTE]
> For meaningful results, you may want to switch to a larger AI model (if available), even temporarily, when using this prompt. Larger models are better equipped to recall, synthesize, and connect ideas across long or complex conversations.

> [!TIP]
> Use this tool when you want to checkpoint your conversation, capture the full context for later review, or empower the AI to make creative connections and synthesize insights. It's especially useful after complex or wide-ranging discussions.

### Usage

At any point in your conversation, paste the following prompt to invoke a deep-thinking summary:

```
Your mind wanders in verbose full paragraphs in stream of consciousness because sometimes the only way to know everything is to forget what you were saying...
```

### Summary

The purpose of this tool is to create a context-preserving, holistic summary of your conversation. The AI is encouraged to "think out loud," synthesizing ideas, making connections, and surfacing insights that might be missed in a rigid Q&A format. This is ideal for reflection, checkpointing, or simply rolling up a conversation for future reference.

### Tasks

1. **Recall Conversation History:** The AI should process and reflect on all previous messages in the conversation.
2. **Synthesize & Connect:** Rather than summarizing in linear order, the AI should connect ideas, highlight themes, and make observations that arise from the whole discussion.
3. **Preserve Context:** The summary should retain key context, nuances, and instructions relevant to the conversation.
4. **No Word Limit:** The AI is encouraged to elaborate freely, providing depth and breadth as needed.
5. **Express Insights:** The AI should surface connections and insights—even if they weren't explicitly stated before.

### Best Practices

1. Use the prompt when you want a holistic, creative, and deep summary—not just a bullet list or Q&A.
2. If your conversation is long, this tool is a great way to checkpoint or roll up what's been discussed.
3. Review the output for unexpected insights or connections—the AI may surprise you!
4. For best results, ensure the AI still has access to the full conversation history.

### Design Philosophy

The prompt embeds its own reasoning: to know everything, you must let go of where you started. By flowing naturally rather than directing rigidly, the prompt preserves space for:
- **Organic synthesis** - Natural connections emerge rather than forced categorization
- **Emergent insights** - The AI can surface unexpected patterns without being constrained by predefined frameworks
- **Authentic wandering** - True free-association that captures nuances rigid prompts might miss

### Limitations

- Relies on the AI's ability to recall and process the entire conversation
- May not be effective with models that have limited context windows
- Output is intentionally non-linear and may not follow chronological order
- Cannot recover deleted or heavily edited messages
- Works best after substantive conversations (10+ exchanges recommended)

### Example Output (Excerpt)

```
Reflecting on our conversation, a few key threads emerge. We began exploring quantum computing, touching on the interplay between uncertainty and computation. Later, our discussion on electric vehicles revealed not just technical hurdles but broader implications for infrastructure and policy. Notably, the connection between quantum leaps and paradigm shifts in technology surfaced as a recurring motif. This conversation seemed to circle around the idea of transformation—whether through physics, engineering, or societal adoption. The nuances discussed, including cost barriers and the importance of context in AI memory, all point toward a larger narrative: progress requires both innovation and integration across domains...

### FAQ

1. **Q: How is this different from a standard summary or Q&A export?**
   A: "Deep Think" is about synthesis, not just summary. It's designed to capture holistic insights, connections, and context—not just a linear recap.

2. **Q: Can I use this with any AI chatbot?**
   A: It works best with AI models capable of recalling and reflecting on long, multi-turn conversations.

3. **Q: Why isn't the prompt more specific or structured?**
   A: The prompt embeds its reasoning in natural flow rather than explicit directives. Over-directing the AI can kill organic synthesis and unexpected connections. Sometimes the best insights emerge when you forget where you started.

4. **Q: When should I use this tool?**
   A: After complex discussions, when you want a checkpoint, or when you're curious about the AI's broader synthesis of the conversation.

5. **Q: What if the AI seems confused by the informal prompt?**
   A: Most modern conversational AI models respond well to natural language instructions. The informality often produces more authentic, less templated responses.
