### FAQ
1. **Q: How often should I update my company research?**
   A: It's best to refresh your research before each application or interview, as company information can change quickly. For rapidly evolving companies like those in tech or startups, consider updating your research weekly.

2. **Q: Can I use this tool for multiple companies?**

3. **Q: What if I can't find all the information requested in the research section?**
   A: Provide as much information as you can find from reliable sources. If certain details are not available, focus on the information you do have. It's also worth noting in your research that some information isn't publicly available, as this can be a good talking point in interviews.

4. **Q: How can I verify the accuracy of the information I've gathered?**
   A: Cross-reference information from multiple sources, prioritize recent and official company communications, and be wary of outdated or unofficial sources. If possible, reach out to current or former employees through professional networks for insights.

5. **Q: Should I include negative information I find about the company?**
   A: While it's important to have a balanced view, focus on presenting factual information. If you encounter negative press or reviews, consider how recent and relevant they are, and think about how you might tactfully address these topics if they come up in an interview.
