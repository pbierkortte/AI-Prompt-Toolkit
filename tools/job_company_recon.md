## How to Use the Generated Overview

4. Incorporate relevant details into your cover letter or application to demonstrate your knowledge and interest in the company.
5. Prepare talking points that align your skills and experiences with the company's needs and values.

## Limitations and Considerations

- The tool relies on publicly available information, which may not always be up-to-date or complete.
- For some smaller or private companies, less information may be available, resulting in a less comprehensive overview.
- Always verify critical information from official sources before making important decisions.
- The generated overview is meant to supplement, not replace, your own research and preparation.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check your internet connection and ensure the AI model has access to online resources.
2. Try using variations of the company name or website if the initial search yields limited results.
3. For very new or niche companies, you may need to supplement the AI-generated overview with additional manual research.

## Tips for Maximizing Effectiveness

1. Use the tool well in advance of your application or interview to allow time for additional research if needed.
2. Compare the generated overview with the company's official website to identify any discrepancies or areas requiring further investigation.
3. Use the overview as a starting point for deeper research into areas most relevant to your specific role and career goals.
4. Regularly update your research, especially for rapidly evolving industries or companies.
