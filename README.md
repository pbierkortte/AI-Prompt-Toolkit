# AI Prompt Toolkit

My Personal Collection of AI Prompts, Code Snippets, and Tips & Tricks for Enhancing AI Projects

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The contents of this repository, including prompts, documentation, code, and generated outputs, are likely AI-generated or AI-assisted (this note included ðŸ˜„).

## Purpose

This repository serves two main purposes:

1. **Sharing Valuable Prompts**: It's a place to share AI prompts that are too good to keep to myself. By making these prompts publicly available, I hope to contribute to the AI community and help others enhance their AI interactions.

2. **Self-Updating TOC**: This README's Table of Contents updates automatically via GitHub Actions, showcasing efficient documentation maintenance. Explore the workflow to implement similar functionality in your own projects.

## Usage

Each file contains a specific prompt or tool with instructions.
